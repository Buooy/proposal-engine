				<p>With an increasing number of organizations exploiting information technology in innovative ways, many companies have been adding a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) to their executive leadership teams.</p>
				<p>
					In general, we can categorize different CTOs into four (4) general models, deriving from two (2) characteristics of the organization.
					<ul>
						<li><b>Revenue Impact</b> : Does the technology have a direct impact on the organisation's revenue?</li>
						<li><b>Strategic Importance</b> : Does technology provide the organisation with a critical competitive advantage?</li>
					</ul>

				<h4>Operational Leader</h4> 
				<p>The operational leader functions in an organisation where technology plays a crucial supporting role and has lower direct impact on revenue e.g. financial and educational institutions.</p>
				</p>As the CTO, he/she is tasked to manage and maintain an existing infrastructure, focusing on ensuring that mission-critical systems are monitored and to enhance the operational capabilities of frontline and supporting staff.</p>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-12">
				<h4>Visionary Leader</h4> 
				<p>The visionary leader is crucial to an organization that utilizes technology to engage users relating to a common goal or vision e.g. NPOs, Government</p>
				<p>As the CTO, he/she is seen as a strategist who can assess the tech landscape, look into the future, identify the use cases/scenarios and develop the technological roadmaps that will facilitate the overall strategy.</p>

				<h4>User Centric Leader</h4> 
				<p>The user centric leader functions in an industry where technology's primary role is in driving revenue, but is either largely undifferentiated from another competitor's competitive advantage or easily replicated by another competitor e.g. e-commerce and media.</p>
				</p>As the CTO, he/she is focused on engaging the end user to understand user behavior and feedback, and develop technological strategies with the intentions of driving revenue.</p>

				<h4>Innovative Leader</h4> 
				<p>The innovative leader functions in a technology company at the forefront of the technological landscape, building platforms with groundbreaking solutions, e.g Salesforce, Google, Oracle.</p>
				</p>As the CTO, he/she foresees the potential problems that technology can solve profitably in the next one to two decades. He/she develops new technologies from scratch, and build platforms that other organizations and individuals can leverage upon.</p>
